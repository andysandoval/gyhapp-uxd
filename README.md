## Description
Galaxy in your hands "GYH" is an application for people who love or are interested in outer space. This project is intended to improve the experience and save time for people related to the topic. Also to mention, due to the advancement in technology, we are glad to mention that the product has augmented reality features, to be more interactive with people and appeal to a wider audience.

## Strategy
## Value Proposal Canvas
The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.
![Canvas](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/bfb87d9be67619e30e6477e0f290a011cd081872/deliverables/Value%20Proposition%20Canvas/Value-Proposition-Canvas.png)

## Scope
## UX Person
After defining our product strategy, it is important to define a scope. To help us, we created 3 UX Persons, who are our ideal clients for our app and this helps us define the scope of the design.

### UX Person 1
![UX-Person-1](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/64aeff87fd75dd139f7f5172607570f01ebeed80/deliverables/UX%20Person/UX%20Person%201.png)
### UX Person 2

### UX Person 3

## User Journey Map
By using the UX Persona tool, we were able to understand what are the main needs that our users will have and how they feel when a problem arises or something happens that they do not like. With the above observations, we concluded through a User Journey Map how our users will react when using the application.

## Benchmarking 
Then, we did a Benchmarking, looking for the main competitors, this gave us an idea of what requirements we have to meet to be a true competitor.
![Benchmarking](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/2c3ca42973704d0d896dabaed50447038f3a6ea0/deliverables/Benchmarking/Benchmarking-V2.png)

## Structure
In this step, we define de Navigation of our app, using a Navigation Diagram, this helps us to realize the Wireframes and the final interfaces.

## Skeleton
As a first instance we created wireframes to get an idea of what our final product would be like, thanks to this we were able to define the solution in a solid way.
![Wireframe](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/e62ab6463f9c20d980fe0624b9b186493992d209/deliverables/Wireframes/Full-Wireframe.png)

## Surface
This is our proposal with the modifications and functionalities implemented in the design of our product.

You can see our HD interfaces in more detail [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/tree/64aeff87fd75dd139f7f5172607570f01ebeed80/deliverables/Interfaces%20HD/Full%20HD%20interface%20Version%202)

## Usability and accessibility
In the second design phase of the "GYH" project, improvements and new functionalities have been applied to our initial proposal. The results and aspects to consider are described in this section.

### Usability evaluation
In this section we will talk a bit about the heuristic evaluation process that was applied in our project. The main reason is that from a different point of view than ours, we may find flaws in the initial design or elements that are not clear to users, so we can correct these errors and apply solutions to implement before final delivery.
Based on the above, we will show a list with the most severe problems found in our project:
- Highlight options from the menu.
- Help guide to use the application
- The Dictionary section it is not ordered alphabetically
- Total change in the forum


### Accessibility
As the culmination of our project, and aware of the possible difficulties that some people may face due to visual problems or illnesses, we have implemented additional measures and configurations with the aim of providing a better user experience. Thanks to these modifications, users will now enjoy greater freedom to customize and adapt the application according to their individual needs. 
The assistive technologies that we have implemented are detailed below:
- Lens Of Colors: Is focused on helping people with visual difficulties or disabilities, specifically those that affect color perception. This technology offers special adjustments and settings that allow users to modify the way colors are presented in an application or device.
- Lens Of Font: It is focused on helping people with visual difficulties or disabilities related to reading texts. This technology provides advanced configuration options to adjust the font, size, and style of text in an application or device. Users can customize the typography to suit their visual needs, such as increasing the size of the text, selecting fonts for greater readability, or adjusting the spacing between letters and lines.

Next we will show the implementation of these technologies to our project:
- Configuration screen: Here you can make the changes you think are convenient if you have visual problems.

## Strategy
## Value Proposal Canvas

The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.

## Scope
## UX Person

After defining our product strategy, is important to define a scope.  To help us, we create 3 UX_Persona, they were the ideal customer for our app and this helped us to define the scope of design.
### UX Person 1

## User Journey Map

By using the UX Persona tool, we were able to understand what are the main needs that our users will have and how they feel when a problem arises or something happens that they do not like. With the above observations, we concluded through a User Journey Map how our users will react when using the application.

## Benchmarking 

Then, we made a Benchmarking, looking for the principal competitors, this gave us an idea of what requirements we have to realize to be a real 
competitors.

## Structure
In this step, we define de Navigation of our app, using a Navigation Diagram, this helps us to realize the Wireframes and the final interfaces.

---
## Skeleton
You can view our initially created wireframes

---
## Surface
The interfaces created were made from the wireframes shown above, plus changes were made to the views based on the comments and suggestions made in a heuristic cross evaluation, and we tried to include most of the suggestions and recommendations resulting in the interfaces shown below.

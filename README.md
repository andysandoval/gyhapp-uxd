## Description
Galaxy in your hands "GYH" is an application for people who love or are interested in outer space. This project is intended to improve the experience and save time for people related to the topic. Also to mention, due to the advancement in technology, we are glad to mention that the product has augmented reality features, to be more interactive with people and appeal to a wider audience.

## Strategy
## Value Proposal Canvas
The first step to finding the problem and a solution was to make a value proposition canvas, this gave us an idea to solve the problem previously mentioned.

## Scope
## UX Person
After defining our product strategy, it is important to define a scope. To help us, we created 3 UX Persons, who are our ideal clients for our app and this helps us define the scope of the design.

### UX Person 1

### UX Person 2

### UX Person 3

## User Journey Map
By using the UX Persona tool, we were able to understand what are the main needs that our users will have and how they feel when a problem arises or something happens that they do not like. With the above observations, we concluded through a User Journey Map how our users will react when using the application.

## Benchmarking 
Then, we did a Benchmarking, looking for the main competitors, this gave us an idea of what requirements we have to meet to be a true competitor.

## Structure
In this step, we define de Navigation of our app, using a Navigation Diagram, this helps us to realize the Wireframes and the final interfaces.

---
## Skeleton
As a first instance we created wireframes to get an idea of what our final product would be like, thanks to this we were able to define the solution in a solid way.
![Wireframe](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/e62ab6463f9c20d980fe0624b9b186493992d209/deliverables/Wireframes/Full-Wireframe.png)
You can see our wireframes in more detail [here](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/tree/efc46408b8c28b6f5ba7e90f52fadcc77b4fc0c8/deliverables/Wireframes)

## Surface
The interfaces created were made from the wireframes shown above. This is not the final version of the product, there are still things to improve and add.
![HD Interface](https://github.com/andysandoval/gyhapp-uxd/blob/e62ab6463f9c20d980fe0624b9b186493992d209/deliverables/Interfaces%20HD/Full-HD-interface.png)

## Usability and accessibility
In the second design phase of the "GYH" project, improvements and new functionalities have been applied to our initial proposal. The results and aspects to consider are described in this section.

### Usability evaluation
